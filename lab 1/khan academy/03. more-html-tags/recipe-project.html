        <p id = "steps"> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Boil meat with salt & onion.
</p>
<p> Put your meat and 1/2 the onion in a deep enough dish to cover it with cold water leaving enough space on the top so that it doesn't boil over. Bring to the boil, constantly removing the foam, Reduce heat to simmer when it starts to boil. Cover it.Let it cook for about 2 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender and falling off the bone. </p>


<p id = "steps"> <strong>Step 2:</strong> Prepare your noodles.
</p>
<p> In a bowl mix the sifted flour (300-400 g), the eggs (whisk the eggs before you add into flour), add salt and pour water until a dough is formed. Knead pastry, adding flour or water as needed. Knead the dough well, wrap in plastic wrap and leave for 20-30 minutes.
Sprinkle the work top with sifted flour and divide your dough into a few small balls
Then keeping the worktop lightly covered with flour roll each piece of pastry into a fairly thin layer. </p>
        
        <p id = "steps"> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Prepare for serving.
</p>
<p> Remove the meat and bones, separate as you will only serve the tender cooked meat. cook the noodles in batches in the same stock for about 7-8 minutes. Sieve them out on to the big plate leaving the space in the center for meat. Then add your meat chopped in bite size pieces and put it in the center of the dish. Pour some broth over the meat. </p>
